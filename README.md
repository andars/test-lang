# test-lang

Experiment in programming language development.

Pretty massive kludge as of now, but educational so it's chill.

It doesn't have integers, but that didn't stop javascript so I'm
fine with it for now.

This works:
```
function factorial n
  if ( n > 1, n * factorial(n-1), 1)
end
puts(factorial(3))
```
